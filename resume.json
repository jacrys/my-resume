William has proven repeatedly that he will live up to any promises he makes, do it in the time frame he promised, and deliver a quality service as a net result. William will rise to the top as the result of helping others, rather than at the expense of others.  He is a hard worker and is very solution-oriented.\r\n  I am a much better tech agent as the result having Wiiliam as my ASG.  I have consistently been ranked in the top 10 per cent of all agents locally and globally, and I must give William his credit in this. With his technical assistance as my first ASG out of my training, I quickly gained the technical confidence needed for this job.
